# relicthief
We use NewRelic APM feature and Synthetic SLA test. 

There are needs to have one place for all dashboards. We use Grafana. 

The relicthief make REST API requests to NewRelic and provide numbers with prometheus /metric endpoints. 

There are two API KEYS (I do not know why it works in this way).
